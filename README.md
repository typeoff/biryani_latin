Biryani Latin
=============

Biryani Latin is a libre font development project. Its fonts are designed in a monolinear, geometric sanserif style. Like several early geometric sans typefaces from the last century, Biryani Latin’s characters have a strong flavor to them; they are more wonky than sterile. Biryani Latin’s fonts are indeed meant for text, just not necessarily for very long, immersive reading-length passages. The letterforms are a bit too “display” for that. 

Biryani Latin is available, libre and gratis. It is a fork of the Biryani fonts availavle from <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Biryani">Google Fonts</a>. The characters are oiginal work developed by Dan Reynolds and Mathieu Réguer.

Two folders are hosted here: <em>Font Files</em> and <em>Source Files</em>. The font files folder contain both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf), as well as Webfonts. The Webfonts are PostScript-flavored. All of the font files were generated with the Glyphs 2 font editing application. The auto-hinted .ttf-files are auto-hinted with ttfautohint version embedded in Glyphs Version 2.5b (1111). The source files folder contain a native Glyphs file as well as UFOs exported from Glyphs.

All files are offered as-is.
